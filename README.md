# About

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ <br>
My name is **Egorov Ivan**, I'm a web developer from **Russia**. <br>
I'm sure that you can learn any language if you need to, so I'm doing what is necessary in any language as best as I can. ðŸ’ª <br>

**_Currently, I'm not looking for a job._** But I'm always open to conversation

## Projects

I found time to organize my projects. Most of them are old test tasks from college or interviews. Not all of them are really relevant, but they are enough to show how broad my interests. If you see public non archived repo then I finally decided to make a serious open source project.
